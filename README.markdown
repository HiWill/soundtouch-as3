SoundTouch AS3
==============

An ActionScript 3 port of the [SoundTouch][1] audio processing library.

SoundTouch AS3 allows realtime playback of processed audio in Flash 10. It currently supports time compression/expansion.

Roadmap
=======

Pitch shifting and playback rate change are include in the original C++ library, and have yet to be ported to ActionScript.
