SoundTouch AS3
==============

An ActionScript 3 port of the [SoundTouch][1] audio processing library.

SoundTouch AS3 allows realtime processing of audio in Flash 10. It includes filters that perform time compression/expansion and rate transposition. In tandem, these filters can perform pitch-shifting.

Roadmap
=======

The original C++ library includes several features that have not yet been implemented in ActionScript, including a FIR filter, which can be used to prevent aliasing during rate transposition.
